# Test Driven Development

## What even is that?

---

**Test-driven development (TDD)** is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:

- first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function

* then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test

- and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

---

# Key Benefits

- Short feedback loops
- Better quality code
- Less time debugging
- Less bugs
- Less time fixing defects
- Confidence refactoring
- You're forced to write small functions focused on one thing
- TDD tells you whether your last change (or refactoring) broke previously working code

---

# Common mistakes

- Testing the function internals
- Thinking it takes too long (Time is made up by not having to fix bugs)
- "How do I know what to test if I dont know what I'm going to write?"
- 100% test coverage (Testing a <button>Button</button> is a button is redundant)
- You don't have to do everything TDD straight away

# üî¥ Red üî¥

Write a failing test

```javascript
test("it should reverse the string", () => {
  const str = "This is a test"
  const expected = "tset a si sihT"
  const result = reverseMyString(str)

  expect(result).toEqual(expected)
})
```

Write just enough code to get it working

```javascript
function reverseMyString(str) {
  let newString = ""
  for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    newString += str[i]
  }
  return newString
}
```

---

# üòé Refactor üòé

Refactor the code safe in the knowledge your code will work

```javascript
function reverseMyString(str) {
  return str
    .split("")
    .reverse()
    .join("")
}
```
